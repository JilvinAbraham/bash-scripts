- **SSH Automation**: Use SSH to perform tasks on remote servers.
- **Download Management**: Automate downloads with `wget` or `curl` for multiple files.


### **4. Development Workflow**
- **Code Deployment**: Automate pulling the latest code from a repository and restarting services.
- **Build and Testing**: Compile code, run tests, and generate reports.
- **Log Parsing**: Analyze application logs to extract meaningful information.
- **Version Control**: Automate repetitive Git tasks, like fetching, pulling, and merging branches.


### **5. Data Processing**
- **Data Extraction**: Parse text files, extract specific data, and format it.
- **File Comparison**: Compare files and directories for differences.
